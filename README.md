# Stax_doubly_linked_list
Doubly Linked List Program for Stax Payment Interview

## Problem Statement:
- Create a C++ program that implements a linked list. 
- The linked list should be a doubly linked list, allowing movement forward and backward. 
- This program should allow you to add and remove nodes from the list. 
- Each node should contain a reference to application data. 
- The program does not have to provide user interaction. 
- Please include units tests for the program. 
- The program can be submitted by including a link to your solution in Github.
